I will try to keep this relatively up to date at www.alexcash.com/nesTweet if you'd like to see a running copy. Please not that to make debugging easier I'm not using a CDN for my scripts, nor are they minified/gzipped. This page is slow to load but the final will not be.

Based on the Ember.js starter kit: http://emberjs.com/
